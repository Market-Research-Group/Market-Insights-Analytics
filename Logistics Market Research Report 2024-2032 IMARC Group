<p><strong>Global Logistics Market Trends:</strong></p>
<p>The global market is primarily driven by the continuous expansion of the e-commerce sector. This trend necessitates a more efficient and scalable logistics infrastructure to manage the increasing volume of online transactions and customer expectations for prompt delivery. Concurrently, technological advancements, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in logistics operations, accompanied by the globalization of trade, requiring comprehensive and reliable networks to facilitate the movement of goods across international borders is fueling the market. Furthermore, the rise in consumer expectations for faster and more reliable delivery services is compelling companies to refine and expedite their logistics operations.</p>
